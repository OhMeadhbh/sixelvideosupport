What is/are Sixel/Sixels?

Sixel is a graphics format supported by DEC VT240, VT241,
VT330 and VT340 series terminals.

It allowed a host computer to stream image data to a terminal,
which would either display the image on the terminal's screen
or use it to define custom characters.

The standard "xterm" terminal emulator on X/Windows and Term2
on recent versions of MS-Windows (10, 11) support Sixel
graphics.

This is interesting because you can now display images on
terminals after ssh'ing into remote systems.

This is very useful because you can create graphical utilities
on remote systems //without// opening a http(s) port.  If you
can ssh to it, you can use it to generate graphics.
